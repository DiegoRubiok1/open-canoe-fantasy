# Project Chronicle

## May 7, 2025
Today I've built the project structure. I had no idea on how to design the architecture, so I got guidance from ChatGPT. After that, I used a database schema to build the SQL script and deployed it to MySQL.

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Set up `config.py` file
- [x] Configure `app/__init__.py` with `create_app()`
- [x] Set up `run.py` configuration

### Next Tasks:
- [ ] Create user models in `/app/models`
- [ ] Implement login blueprint at `app/api/auth` following `docs/structure.md`
